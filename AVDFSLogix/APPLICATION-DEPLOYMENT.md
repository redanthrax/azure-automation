# Application Deployment Strategies for Azure Virtual Desktop with FSLogix

## Overview

For Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) with FSLogix environments, there are several standard approaches for deploying applications. Each method has different use cases, benefits, and complexity levels.

## 1. 🎯 **MSIX App Attach (Recommended Modern Approach)**

### What is MSIX App Attach?
- **Dynamic Application Delivery**: Applications are packaged as MSIX and mounted at runtime
- **Separation of Concerns**: Apps, OS, and user data remain separate
- **Just-in-Time Delivery**: Applications appear instantly without traditional installation

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Fast Login Times**: No app installation during user login
- ✅ **Reduced Image Size**: Base image contains only OS and core apps
- ✅ **Easy Updates**: Update MSIX packages without touching session hosts
- ✅ **Resource Efficient**: Apps share resources across sessions
- ✅ **Rollback Capability**: Easy to revert to previous app versions

### Implementation Architecture:
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Session Host  │────│  MSIX Package    │────│  File Share     │
│   (Base Image)  │    │  (App Container) │    │  (App Storage)  │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                        │                        │
         ▼                        ▼                        ▼
    Windows 11              Office 365.msix         \\storage\apps\
     + AVD Agent           Chrome.msix              Office365.vhd
                          Photoshop.msix            Chrome.vhd
```

### Use Cases:
- Office 365 / Microsoft 365
- Modern Windows applications
- Line-of-business apps (with MSIX conversion)
- Frequently updated applications

## 2. 🏗️ **Custom Image with Pre-installed Apps (Traditional)**

### What is Custom Image Deployment?
- **Pre-baked Images**: Applications installed in the base VM image
- **Golden Image**: Single image contains OS + all required applications
- **Image Replication**: Same image deployed across all session hosts

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Traditional approach, well understood
- ✅ **Compatibility**: Works with all application types
- ✅ **Predictable Performance**: All apps pre-installed and ready
- ✅ **Legacy Support**: Best for older applications

### Challenges:
- ❌ **Large Images**: Images become very large with many apps
- ❌ **Update Complexity**: Need to rebuild entire image for app updates
- ❌ **Resource Waste**: All apps installed even if not used by all users
- ❌ **Slower Provisioning**: Larger images take longer to deploy

### Implementation Process:
```powershell
# 1. Create base VM
New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "rg-image-build" -Name "vm-golden-image"

# 2. Install applications
# - Office 365
# - Line of business apps
# - Browsers, tools, etc.

# 3. Run Sysprep
C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep\sysprep.exe /generalize /oobe /shutdown

# 4. Capture image
$vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "rg-image-build" -Name "vm-golden-image"
$image = New-AzImageConfig -Location $vm.Location -SourceVirtualMachineId $vm.Id
New-AzImage -Image $image -ImageName "img-avd-golden" -ResourceGroupName "rg-images"
```

## 3. 📦 **App Layering with FSLogix App Masking**

### What is App Layering?
- **Layered Architecture**: OS, apps, and user data in separate layers
- **Dynamic Composition**: Layers combined at runtime based on user/group membership
- **Granular Control**: Different app sets for different user groups

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Personalization**: Different apps for different user groups
- ✅ **Efficient Storage**: Apps shared across multiple images
- ✅ **Granular Updates**: Update individual app layers
- ✅ **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer image variants to maintain

### Architecture:
```
User Session = Base OS Layer + App Layer(s) + User Profile
             ├── Windows 11 AVD
             ├── Office 365 Layer (for all users)
             ├── Adobe Creative Layer (for designers)
             ├── Developer Tools Layer (for developers)
             └── User Profile (FSLogix)
```

## 4. 🚀 **Intune Application Deployment**

### What is Intune Deployment?
- **Cloud-based Management**: Deploy apps through Microsoft Intune
- **Policy-driven**: Apps deployed based on user/device policies
- **Automatic Updates**: Apps update automatically through Intune

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Centralized Management**: Single pane of glass for app deployment
- ✅ **Automatic Updates**: Apps stay current automatically
- ✅ **User-based Deployment**: Apps follow users across devices
- ✅ **Compliance Integration**: Ensure only approved apps are installed

### Implementation:
```powershell
# 1. Package application for Intune
$intuneAppPackage = New-IntuneWin32AppPackage -SourceFolder "C:\Apps\MyApp" -SetupFile "setup.exe"

# 2. Create app in Intune
$app = New-IntuneWin32App -DisplayName "My Business App" -PackageFile $intuneAppPackage

# 3. Assign to user groups
Add-IntuneWin32AppAssignment -Id $app.Id -Target "group:AVD-Users" -Intent "required"
```

## 5. 🛠️ **Configuration Management Tools**

### Popular Tools:
- **PowerShell DSC**: Declarative configuration management
- **Ansible**: Automation and configuration management
- **Chef/Puppet**: Infrastructure as code
- **Azure Automation**: Cloud-based configuration management

### Example with PowerShell DSC:
```powershell
Configuration AVDApplications {
    param(
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost'
    )
    
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName xPSDesiredStateConfiguration
    
    Node $NodeName {
        # Install Chrome
        xPackage Chrome {
            Name = "Google Chrome"
            Path = "https://dl.google.com/chrome/install/ChromeStandaloneSetup64.exe"
            ProductId = ""
            Arguments = "/silent /install"
        }
        
        # Install Office 365
        xPackage Office365 {
            Name = "Microsoft 365 Apps"
            Path = "\\fileserver\apps\Office365\setup.exe"
            ProductId = ""
            Arguments = "/configure configuration.xml"
        }
    }
}
```
